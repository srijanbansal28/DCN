Simulation 5: Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot
the congestion window for different source/destination.
Step 1: Create a New Project
Step 2: Create the Network
Select Object Palette box.
Select internet_toolbox from drop down menu. Choose ethernet_wkstn objects (3 numbers).
Choose ehternet_server object (1 number). Ethernet16hub (1) from Ethernet tool box
Choose Application Config, and Profile Config objects.
Choose 10baseT link and connect the nodes.
Close the Object Palette box.
Step 3: Configure the Network Application
Select Application config object.
Right click and select Edit Attributes.
Select Application Definitions => set row = 2.
In row go to row0 => set Name = ftp. Select description => set ftp = > High Load.
In row go to row1 => set Name = volce. Select description => set voice = > GSM Quality
Speech.
Check Apply Changes to Selected Objects.
Step 4: Configure the Profile
Select Profile config node.
Right click and select Edit Attributes.
Select Profile Configuration. Set row = 2.
In rowo, set Profile Name = ftp profile. Select Applications. Set row=1.Go to rowo set Name
= ftp, Start Time Offset to constant(1), in Repeatability, Inter Repetition Time to exponential (0.1)
and Number of Repetition to unlimited and Repetition Pattern to concurrent.
At rowo set Name = ftp, Start Time Offset to constant(1), in Repeatability, Inter Repetition
Time to exponential(0.1) and Number of Repetition to unlimited and Repetition Pattern to
concurrent.
In row1, set Profile Name = voice profile. Select Applications. Set row=1.Go to row1 set
Name = voice, Start Time Offset to constant(1), in Repeatability, Inter Repetition Time to
exponential (0.1) and Number of Repetition to unlimited and Repetition Pattern to concurrent.
At row1 set Name = video, Start Time Offset to constant(1), in Repeatability, Inter
Repetition Time to exponential (0.1) and Number of Repetition to unlimited and Repetition Pattern
to concurrent.
Check Apply Changes to Selected Objects.
Step 5: Configure Network Objects
Select any Ethernet_wskt.
Right click and Select Similar Nodes.
Right click and select Edit Attributes.
Select Application Support Profiles => set rows to 2.
In rows => go to rowo => set Profile Name = ftp profile
In rows => go to row1 => set Profile Name = voice profile.
Select Application Support Services. Select edit => set rows 1. Set Name = voice for that
row.
Check Apply Changes to Selected Objects.
Click Ok.
Select ethernet_server object.
Right click and select Edit Attributes.
Select Application Support Services. Select edit => se rows 1. Set Name = ftp for that row.
Check Apply Changes to Selected Objects.
Click Ok.
Step 6: Selecting Statistics for viewing:
In Node Statistics => select TCP Connection => select Congestion Window Size (bytes)
Step 7: Run the simulation
Click run simulation icon from the toolbar.
Set the Duration to 20 seconds.
Click Run.
