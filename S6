Simulation 6: Simulate simple BSS and with transmitting nodes in wireless LAN by simulation
and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.
Step 1: Create a New Project
Step 2: Create the Network
Select Object Palette box.
Select wireless_lan_adv from drop down menu.
Choose wlan_station_sdv(fix) 4 numbers
Step 3: Configure the Network Application (Select Topology icon ->open Annotation Palette
>(choose circle) and annotation.) include all 4 nodes in a circle
Select any wlan_station_adv object in the workspace.
Right click on the selected object and Select Similar Nodes.
Right click and select Edit Attributes.
Select Traffic Generation Parameters => set Start Time to constant (> set ON State to
constant (100) => set OFF State to constant (0).
Please Note: If the field to set Start Time to constant(1) is disabled for some reason, please
change the value from 'Never' to 'Not Used'
Select Packet Generation Arguments =>set Interarrival Time to exponential(1).
Check Apply Changes to Selected Objects.
Click Ok.
Step 4: Selecting Statistics for viewing:
Right click on the workspace and select Choose Individual Statistics.
In Node Statistics => select Wireless LAN => select Data Traffic Rcvd (packets/sec) and
select Data Traffic send (packets/sec).
Step 5: Run the simulation
Click run simulation icon from the toolbar.
Set the Duration to 100 seconds.
Click Run.
Step 6: View Results
Right click on the work space and select View Results
Change As Is to Sample_Sum.
Result Interpretation: We see that on an average 1 packet is sent per second and around 2.5
packets are received per second. This is because the transmissions of the other 3 stations are also
being received by this station. There are some losses as well which can be seen by including global
statistics (bit/sec).
