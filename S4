Simulation 4: Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N nodes (6-10). Change the data rate and
compare throughput and bit error rate.
Step 1: Create a New Project
Step 2: Create the network
Select topology=>rapid configuration. From the drop down menu choose star and click Ok.
In the rapid configuration dialog: star box, set the following values:
Central node model = ethernet16_hub, Periphery node model = Ethernet_station,
Link model = 10baseT.
Step 3: Configuring Ethernet Stations:
Right click on any Ethernet station => Select similar nodes Edit Attributes
Set Traffic generation parameters and Packet Generation Arguments.
Start Time=Constant(0)
ON State Time=Constant(100)
OFF State Time=Constant(0)
Interarrival Time=Constant(1.0)
Check Apply changes to selected objects.
Click Ok.
Step 4: Choose Statistics
Right Click on work space => Choose Individual Statistics In Link Statistics => low level
point-to-point=> bit error per packet
=> point-to-point =>throughput[packets/sec] -> & <-
Click OK
Step 5: Run Simulation
Click on Run Button
Set Duration to 70 seconds
Click Run
Step 5: View & Compare results:
Change the data rate by changing the inter arrival time
Scenario 1: inter arrival time is constant 1
Scenario 2: inter arrival time is constant 0.1
Result Interpretation: The data rate is changed by changing the Inter Arrival Rate.
First Scenario Constant 1 implies the interarrival rate is less than Constant 0.1, Second
Scenario. When Interarrival time increases, data rate increases implying that the throughput
is increased as long as there is no collision.
