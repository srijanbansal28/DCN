Simulation 3:
Simulate the transmission of PING message over a network topology consisting of 4 nodes
and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.

Step 1: Create a new Project.
Step 2: Create the network:
 Select four Ethernet work stations from Ethernet too in object palette.
 Select an Ethernet16 hub from Ethernet tools in obje palette.
 Connect the components using 10Base_T links.
 Select the IP attribute definition from Ethernet tools object palette.
 Select IP_ping_traffic object palette. pics trotic from internet tools in
Step 3: Configuring the IP Attribute Definition object.
 Right Click on IP Attribute Definition object in work space
 Select Edit Attribute=>IP Ping Parameters.
 Set parameters as shown below.
o Intervel(sec)=1.0
o Time Out=0.1
Please Note: It is 10Base T Connection between the nodes and the hub in a Star Topology. It is a
PING Model between the nodes. You need to connect to and from the node to simulate a bi-
directional ping as is required in this question.
Step 4: Configuring IP Ping Links:
 Right Click on any one IP ping link and select similar Demands.
 Select any one Ping link and Edit its attributes as below:
o Interrepetition time=Constant(1)
o Max Repetition count = unlimited
o Start Time= Constant(1)
Step 5: Choose Individual Statistics:
o Right click on the work space and choose individual statistics.
o Node Statistics => IP => (Ping Replies, Ping Request Sent, Ping Response Time, Traffic
Dropped)
Step 6: Duplicate the scenario
In this scenario remove any link between the hub and workstation.
Step 7.Run the Simulation:
 Click on Run Button
 Set Duration to 100 seconds.
 Click on Run.
Step 8: View and Compare the results
Result Interpretation:
When node 12 is disconnected both the ping packets are dropped. This is shown in justified by the
graph. We see similar results for node 11 and node 9 which must drop 1 packet. However there
should be no change for node 10. Packet generation rate is 1 ping packet per destination per second.
Simulation 4: Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N nodes (6-10). Change the data rate and
compare throughput and bit error rate.
Step 1: Create a New Project
Step 2: Create the network
Select topology=>rapid configuration. From the drop down menu choose star and click Ok.
In the rapid configuration dialog: star box, set the following values:
Central node model = ethernet16_hub, Periphery node model = Ethernet_station,
Link model = 10baseT.
Step 3: Configuring Ethernet Stations:
Right click on any Ethernet station => Select similar nodes Edit Attributes
Set Traffic generation parameters and Packet Generation Arguments.
Start Time=Constant(0)
ON State Time=Constant(100)
OFF State Time=Constant(0)
Interarrival Time=Constant(1.0)
Check Apply changes to selected objects.
Click Ok.
Step 4: Choose Statistics
Right Click on work space => Choose Individual Statistics In Link Statistics => low level
point-to-point=> bit error per packet
=> point-to-point =>throughput[packets/sec] -> & <-
Click OK
Step 5: Run Simulation
Click on Run Button
Set Duration to 70 seconds
Click Run
Step 5: View & Compare results:
Change the data rate by changing the inter arrival time
Scenario 1: inter arrival time is constant 1
Scenario 2: inter arrival time is constant 0.1
Result Interpretation: The data rate is changed by changing the Inter Arrival Rate.
First Scenario Constant 1 implies the interarrival rate is less than Constant 0.1, Second
Scenario. When Interarrival time increases, data rate increases implying that the throughput
is increased as long as there is no collision.
