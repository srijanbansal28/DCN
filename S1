Simulation 1:
Simulate three node point-to-point networks with duplex links between them. Set the queue
size and vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.

Solution:
Step 1: Create a New Project
Step 2: Create the Network
 Select the Object Palette box.
 Select Client-server from the drop-down menu.
 Choose eth4_slip4_multihomed_client objects (3 numbers).
 Choose Application Config and Profile Config objects.
 Choose the 10baseT link and connect the client nodes.
 Close the Object Palette box.
Step 3: Configure the Application Config
 Select the Application config object.
 Right-click and select Edit Attributes.
 Select Application Definitions => set row = 1.
 In row go to row0 => set Name = video. Select description => set Video Conferencing =
High Resolution Video.
 Check Apply Changes to Selected Objects.
 Click Ok.
Step 4: Configure the Profile config
 Select Profile config object.
 Right-click and select Edit Attributes.
 Select Profile Configuration. Set row = 1,
 In row0, set Profile Name = video profile.
 Select Applications. Set row=1.Go to row0 set Name = video, Start Time Offset to
constant(1), in Repeatability, Inter Repetition Time to constant(1) and Number of
Repetition to unlimited and Repetition Pattern to concurrent.
 In Repeatability, Inter Repetition Time to constant (1) and Number of Repetition to
exponential (0.1) and
 Repetition Pattern to Concurrent.
 Check Apply Changes to Selected Objects.
 Click Ok.
Step 5: Configure Node Objects
 Select any eth4_slip4_multihomed_client.
 Right click and Select Similar Nodes.
 Right click and select Edit Attributes.
 Select Application Support Profiles => set rows to 1.
 In rows => go to row0 => set Profile Name = video profile.
 Select Application Support Services. Select edit => set rows =1. Set Name = video for that
row.
 Select IP Processing Information => set Memory Size to 8MB => set Datagram
Forwarding Rate to 5000.
 Check Apply Changes to Selected Objects.
 Click Ok.
Step 6: Selecting Statistics for viewing results
 Right click on the work space and select choose individual DES statistics => in Global
Statistics go to IP,
select traffic dropped.
 In Node Statistics => select IP =>Traffic Dropped (Packets/Sec), Traffic Received
(Packets/Sec) and
Traffic Sent (Packets/Sec).
 Click Ok.
Step 7: Run the simulation
 Click run simulation icon from the toolbar.
 Set the Duration to 120 seconds.
 Click Run.
Step 8: View Results
 Right click on the work space and select View Results.
 Select the statistics from the View Results.
 Select Sample Sum instead of As Is.
 Click Show button to view the graphs.
To Vary Bandwidth and Queue Size:
1. Select Duplicate Scenario from the Scenario menu. Name the scenario.
2. You can vary the queue size and bandwidth by changing the values of Memory size and
Datagram Forwarding
Rate as in Step 5 of the procedure above. Change it to 16 Mb and 10000 respectively.
3. Run the Simulation. You can compare the results by clicking on Compare Results from the
Results menu. Ideally the number of packets dropped must be less .
